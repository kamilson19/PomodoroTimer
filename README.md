# PomodoroTimer
  PomodoroTimer allows you to divide your learning time into sessions.
  One session is made of "LEARN" and "BREAK" phase.
  This program allows you to set duration of learning phase up to 30 minutes, which will be followed with 5 minutes of break.
  There are special sounds to let you know that each session is over.
